Respected Sir,
I, Rahul Yadav, have started the assignment given to me from stratch and had tried to complete it with
minimum use of online animation queries as per the given condition in the assignment.
I have used the following development technologies for this:
1> HTML
2> CSS
3> Bootstrap
4> Javascript

I would like to say that the following webpage is very simple to access and load. 
Basic Important Features:
1> use of Courasel (Bootstrap) instead of Flexslider(javascript) because of its ease and less complex.
2> use of javascript mainly for event handling and DOM architecture.
3> Use of glyphicons and font awesome instead of images to reduce page size and fast loding of page.
4> Page is responsive and can work same way at any size of screen.
4> Gallery section side bar works on hidden and show property to toggle between what user wants.

What more can I add to this page?
1> To make it more attractive we can use Parrallax.
2> Animation can be added to make it more responsive. 

webdevelopment is specially a feild of imagination and creativity. If you want me to make it more dynamic and 
attractive I can do that for you but the type of work our firm is doing it is very important for a lay man to 
understand the basic services that we are providing.
I hope I made myself clear about my work
Thanks a lot for considering me for this opportunity.
Regards 
Rahul Yadav
